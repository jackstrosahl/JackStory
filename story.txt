Jack was tasked with writing a short paragraph for an assignment on git.  But, he didn't know what to write.  But then he thought, "Meta!"
Another Jack also doesn't know what to say. So he decides to write some meaningless sentances to make it look like a paragraph. Aha! three sentances make it a paragraph!
The last Jack seen the story and decide to make the story complete. However he does not know what to say either. Finally, Jacks made the story. The story begans with Jack working
tirelessly to complete his story and ends with him sucessfully completing the task. Jack is a team hero. Jack completes tasks. Be like Jack.
Satisified with his work, Jack submits his story.  "Phew, I don't know how I came up with all that content" he thinks to himself.  The trick his, he didn't.
